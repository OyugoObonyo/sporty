# Sporty

## Introduction
Sporty is a simple ecommerce marketplace for sports gear, and equipment. The application has been built using Python's Flask framework on the backend and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap on the frontend. The application's features include:
* User authentication
* Shopping cart
* Brand and category filtering


## Concepts covered
The app was built so as to deepen my understanding on concepts such as structuring a medium-sized web application, blueprints in Flask, bootstrap, image uploads in Flask and error handling.

A live version of the application can be found at https://bruno-sporty.herokuapp.com/
